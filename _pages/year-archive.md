<b>In Riemann's footsteps'</b><br>
I keep an expository [blog](riemannfootsteps.blogspot.com) about mathematics. 
<br>
<b>[An online Kazakh grammar learning tool]</b><br>
I have developed an online Kazakh grammar learning tool using context-free grammar techniques (available [here](kazhymurat.ml/kazakh)). 
It is actively used by NIS PM Almaty students.

<b>[Teaching calculus: a case study of NIS PM Almaty]</b>
<br>
When I was a junior, I analyzed the methods for teaching calculus at NIS PM Almaty. [Here](kazhymurat.ml/files/Math_teaching.pdf) is a report on my findings. 
Some of my suggestions (e.g. including more examples illustrating the difference between continuous and smooth functions) are now used in the calculus teaching process at NIS PM Almaty.
