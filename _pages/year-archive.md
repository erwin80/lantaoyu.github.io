<b>In Riemann's footsteps'</b><br>
I keep an expository [blog](riemannfootsteps.blogspot.com) about mathematics.

<b>A learning seminar on college-level mathematics</b><br>
I am the organizer of a seminar on advanced mathematics at NIS PM Almaty. The proceedings of the seminar corresponding to the academic year 2017-18 were published via [Gumroad](https://gum.co/fEKzA).

<b>Physics olympiad for high school students </b><br>
I organized a physics olympiad for the students of NIS PM Almaty when I was a freshman and a sophomore. When I was a junior, I co-organized (with T. Ibraev and D. Tulenov) an olympiad for students from 3 cities of Kazakhstan (Almaty, Semey, Pavlodar). In total, there were about 70 participants. [Here](files/3_town.pdf) are the proceedings of the olympiad.

<b>An online Kazakh grammar learning tool</b><br>
I have developed an online Kazakh grammar learning tool using context-free grammar techniques (available [here](kazakh)). 
It is actively used by NIS PM Almaty students.

<b>Teaching calculus: a case study of NIS PM Almaty</b>
<br>
When I was a junior, I analyzed the methods for teaching calculus at NIS PM Almaty. [Here](files/Math_teaching.pdf) is a report on my findings. 
Some of my suggestions (e.g. including more examples illustrating the difference between continuous and smooth functions) are now used in the calculus teaching process at NIS PM Almaty.
