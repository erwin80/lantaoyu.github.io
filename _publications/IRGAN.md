## Abstract
The present study is devoted to understanding whether the currently used
methods in NIS PM Almaty are effective in teaching 11th grade students the
concepts of limit, continuity and differentiability and analyzing the reasons for
their effectiveness. Student survey is used to objectively measure the effectiveness
of the teaching methods; teacher interviewing is employed to identify the problems underlying students' incorrect understanding of certain topics. 
Note: The results of this study were used to optimize the teaching methods used in the calculus course in NIS PM Almaty.
